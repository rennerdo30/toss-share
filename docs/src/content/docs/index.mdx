# Toss Documentation

> Securely share your clipboard across all your devices

Welcome to the Toss documentation! Toss is a cross-platform clipboard sharing application with end-to-end encryption that allows you to copy on one device and paste on another - securely and instantly.

## Quick Links

- [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) - Install Toss on your platform
- [User Guide](user-guide/overview.md) - Learn how to use Toss
- [Developer Guide](developer-guide/architecture.md) - Build and contribute

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All clipboard data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM before leaving your device
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android
- **Local-First**: Direct peer-to-peer sync on local networks for minimal latency
- **Relay Fallback**: Cloud relay server for syncing when devices aren't on the same network
- **Multiple Content Types**: Supports text, images, files, and URLs
- **Easy Pairing**: QR code or 6-digit code for secure device pairing
- **Privacy Focused**: Zero-knowledge architecture - relay servers can't read your data

## Security

Toss takes security seriously:

- **X25519** key exchange for secure device pairing
- **AES-256-GCM** authenticated encryption for all data
- **Ed25519** signatures for device identity
- **Zero-knowledge relay**: The relay server only sees encrypted blobs
- **Forward secrecy**: Session keys are rotated regularly
