# Pairing Devices

Connect your devices to start syncing clipboard content.

## Pairing Methods

Toss supports two methods for pairing devices:

### 1. QR Code (Recommended)

1. On **Device A**: Open Toss and click "Add Device"
2. A QR code will be displayed on the screen
3. On **Device B**: Open Toss and click "Scan QR Code"
4. Point Device B's camera at the QR code on Device A
5. Devices will automatically pair once the QR code is scanned

### 2. 6-Digit Code

1. On **Device A**: Open Toss and click "Add Device"
2. A 6-digit pairing code will be displayed
3. On **Device B**: Open Toss and click "Enter Code"
4. Enter the 6-digit code from Device A
5. Devices will pair after code verification

## Pairing Process

During pairing:

1. **Key Exchange**: Devices exchange public keys using X25519
2. **Verification**: Both devices verify the pairing code/QR code
3. **Session Key**: A shared session key is derived for encryption
4. **Connection**: Devices establish a secure connection (P2P or via relay)

## Security

- All pairing uses end-to-end encryption
- Pairing codes expire after 5 minutes
- Each device generates a unique identity key
- Session keys are derived securely using X25519 key exchange

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Scanning

- Ensure good lighting
- Hold device steady
- Make sure QR code is fully visible
- Try the 6-digit code method instead

### Pairing Code Expired

- Generate a new pairing code on Device A
- Codes expire after 5 minutes for security

### Connection Failed

- Check that both devices are on the same network (for P2P)
- Verify internet connection (for relay fallback)
- Ensure firewall allows Toss connections
